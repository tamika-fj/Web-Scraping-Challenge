Module 11 Web-Scraping Challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called Web-scraping-challenge this contains a juptyer notebook file called part_1_mars_news which contains the code for part 1 of the assignment and also a file called mars_dictionary_json which is the exported jsonified version of the title:preview dictionary created. There is a second jupyter notebook called part_2_mars_weather which contains the code for part 2 of the assignment. There is also a csv file called Mars_weather_dataframe which is a csv export of the weather dataframe created in part 2. To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. Additionaly I learnt how to export the dictionary as a JSON file from https://www.datasciencecentral.com/how-to-use-python-to-loop-through-html-tables-and-scrape-tabular-data/.
